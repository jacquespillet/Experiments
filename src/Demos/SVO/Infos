Algorithm : 

Voxelize the world using the technique from OpenGLInsights
Mipmap it

trace cones from the fragment shader.
each step of the tracing uses a higher level of mipmap.
Use front back compositing. It also allows to compute a good estimation of occlusion.
If the alpha value is high, it means that we occluded a lot of objects. If it's dark, the cone was shot in the void --> no occlusion
