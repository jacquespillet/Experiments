Render the scene in a geometry buffer, usual deferred rendering

render an AABB on top of the geometry buffer for each decal.
in the fragment shader of the box, check the world position underneath, and check if it's within the box.
if it's not, discard the pixel.

it results in only the fragments on the underlying surface being shaded.

we can then compute the texture coordinates checking the local position in the box ([-0.5, 0.5]) and adding 0.5 to it to get [0-1] interval
