Build centroid list :
for each face of the model
    calculate the centroid of the face

Build edge points list :
for each edge in the model
    Calculate the "edge point" of the edge.
    it is a weighted average of the edge mid point, and 
    of the 2 faces that share this edge.
    Effectively, it pushes the edge point towards the face positions

Build old position list :
Store all the old positions

Move all the vertex positions :
For each vertex in the model
    calculate the average position of all the faces that share this vertex
    calculate the average edge mid point of all the edges that share this vertex (Not the edge points !)
    calculate the new position using a combination of :
        old vertex position
        average face position
        average edge position

For each face in the model
    Subdivide the face into 6 triangles
        Use the 3 previously calculated new positions of the face
        Use the 3 previously calculated edge mid points of the face
        Use the old face centroid

        3 triangles :
            new position, with edge mid points
        3 triangles :
            edge mid points with face centroid
