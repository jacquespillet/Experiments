A reflective shadow map is a set of textures that are being rendered from the light point of view.
It includes a depth texture (Same as a regular shadow map), a position texture, a normal texture and a flux texture.

when lighting a fragment, we can find the position of the fragment in the reflective shadow map.
We then have access to information about the surrounding geometry and its color.
We can use this information to apply some of the indirect lighting.

It is very slow because it needs around 400 samples of the RSM for each rendered pixel.
